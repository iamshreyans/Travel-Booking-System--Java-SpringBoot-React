## Test the API's using Swagger (Testing during development)

Swagger / OpenAPI, is a specification and toolset used to describe and interact with RESTful web services.

With Swagger, we can use a web-based UI that allows interactation with the API endpoints and test its functionality. This UI is automatically generated based on the OpenAPI specification and provides a user-friendly interface for sending requests, inspecting responses, and debugging issues.

To access Swagger, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html`](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html).
2. You should see the Swagger UI, which provides an interactive documentation of the API developed.
3. You can explore the available endpoints and their parameters, and test them out using the Swagger UI.

```
cd Travel-Booking-System-Client/
```
